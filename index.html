            <h2>Welcome to Our Page</h2>
            <p>
                We are committed to ornithology; both as a pursuit and a means of studying the winged creatures who
                inhabit our world.
                Our site contains a great deal of information about many species; their habitats, migratory patterns and
                distribution, and
                links to their threat status per the <abbr title="World Wildlife Federation">WWF</abbr>.
            </p>
            <p>
                We also have <a href="http://style.org/unladenswallow/" target="_blank">data/aispeed velocity on the unladed swallow</a>; both European and African.
            </p>
            <p>
                So, don't waste time! Get out and get what you need! Turn off that computer and get out into the great
                outdoors!
